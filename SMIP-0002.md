## Motivation

SVM v0.2 should come with the minimum set of features required for implementing the [_Smart Wallet App_][smart-wallet].
<br>/>
The implementation should be compatible with future SVM versions. It means that we need to carefully think about the next steps.
<br>/>
We must strive not to implement things which will have to be maintained only as backward-compatibility for the _Smart Wallet App_.


## Specification 

#### Data-Layout

Each deployed `App Template` will contain along its code (i.e wasm program) a section containing metadata.
<br>/>
The metadata section will include the data-layout specification for storage of the program.

Each fixed-size program variable will have an index (a.k.a `var_id`), `offset` and `len` (byte-length). 
<br>/>
The `var_id` and `offset` are zero-indexed and `len` is within range `[1 - 8]`

Here is an example for a data-layout.
```
+----------+---------+-------+
|  var_id  |  offset |  len  |
+--------------------+-------+
|    0     |    0    |   2   |
|    1     |    2    |   4   |
|    2     |    6    |   8   |
|    3     |   14    |   2   |
+----------------------------+
```

In case a program has no explicit data-layout, it'll fallback to a default data-layout where each variable 
is of `8` bytes. So the variable `#i` will map to `offset=8 * i`.
<br>/>

SVM's Storage Layer will expose two functions named `get64` and `set64` for reading and writing variables respectively.
<br>/>

In order to read variable with `var_id=2` - a wasm program will call `get64(2)` and receive a `value` of 64-bit integer.
<br>/>
The Storage Layer will always return 64-bit even for variables having `len < 8`.
<br>/>
It'll be able to do since it'll have access to the data-layout of the program.
<br>/>
Similary, a wasm program asking to write `value=100` to `var_id=2` will call `set64(2, 100)`.

<br>/>

So for SVM v0.2 - each wasm program could (optionally) use only these 2 imports functions for dealing for app's storage:
```
func get64(var_id: i32) -> value: i64
func set64(var_id: i32, value: i64)
```

#### Storage Gas cost

SVM will have an internal Gas cost table for each import function (storage and others).
<br>/>
Each call to `get64` and `set64` will cost the same amount of gas respectively.
<br>/>

The reason for writing above that imports are optional is because each program may use a different set of imports.
<br>/>
For the scope of the _SVM Wallet App_ - the program will of course use both functions.


## Rationale

The design of SVM should be minimal, usable for the future and gas-estimation friendly.
<br>/>
Regarding the minimal - having only the above imports should be enough for the _Smart Wallet App_.
<br>/>
Also, future programs will benefit from it. Almost any program will have fixed-size variables.

<br/>
As of gas-estimation friendly - We could add more imports like: `get8`, `get16`, `get24` and similar in order 
to differentiate between the size of the variable.
<br>/>

However, since each variable byte-length is within range `[1 - 8]` we've decided to have the same gas cost regardless of the variable size.
It still keeps the door open for adding future calls specifying the exact variable length but it's unlikely it'll be required.
<br>/>
A more important gas factor should that taken into account is the total size of the variables. 
This should incentivize written programs to specify the minimum required storage.

<br>/>
* Open Subject (Gas activation cost):
<br>/>
Another gas-factor that we need to count on is the way data is persisted.
<br>/>
Given the same data-layout implemented by two different storage layers - 
if one implementation uses much less storage we might to reflect that in the total gas.
(For example, if we could tell as part of the program metadata the maximum blob size for the underlying key-value store used).

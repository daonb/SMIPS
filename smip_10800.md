## Overview

This is a process SMIP describing the cycle used to release a new 
version of SpaceMesh Node.
The cycle starts with a commit and ends with a public announcements of 
the new network.

## Goals and motivation

- Improve communication with contributors
- Automate the release process
- Simplify debugging failed deployments

## High-level design

- Semantic Versioning
- Release management is left to humans
- Each PR comes with a line in the changelog explaining the fix|add to the user

## Proposed Process

When the deus ex machina decide to release a version, the release manager
needs to: 

- review git log and the changelog and fix what's needed
- create a release commit, adding the version and its date to the changelog 
- `git tag vX.Y.Z-rcN`
- `git push nextnet`

The `nextnet` branch is used as reference to the version currently being 
deployed. It's a protected branch, so only authorized contributors can 
push to it and trigger a github pipeline that deploys a new network, test it 
and if all is well, takes it public.

To take it public the release manager tags the version with a clean vX.Y.Z
and pushes it the `net` branch. The push triggers a pipeline to redirect
the dns to point to network foremerly know as nextnet, notify the community and
shut the old network.
